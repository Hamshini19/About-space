		<h2 id = "What-is-space">What is space?</h2>
        <p>Space is everything in the universe<br> 
		beyond the top of the Earth's atmosphere – <br>the Moon, 
		where the GPS satellites orbit, Mars, <br>other stars, 
		the Milky Way, black holes, and distant quasars.</p>
        <h2 id = "Solar-system">The solar system</h2>
		<p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun<br> and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects<br> that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with<br> the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.</p>
		<h2 id = "The-sun">The Sun</h2>
		<p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system,<br> where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8 percent<br> of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times<br> the diameter of the Earth - about one million Earths could <br>fit inside the sun.The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way.</p>
		<h2 id = "Mercury">Mercury</h2>
		<p>Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets.<br> It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. ... <br>Because it's the closest planet to the sun, it doesn't take very long to go all the way around.<br> It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days.</p>
		<h2 id = "Venus">Venus</h2>
		<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess<br> of love and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon,<br> Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion,<br> visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.</p>
		<h2 id = "Earth">Earth</h2>
		<p>Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet from the sun,<br> Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life. With a radius of 3,959 miles,<br> Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface.</p>
		<h2 id = "The-moon">The moon</h2>
		<p>Moons - also known as natural satellites - orbit planets and asteroids. <br>There are more than 200 moons in our solar system. Most orbit the<br> giant planets - with Saturn and Jupiter leading moon counts - <br>but even smaller worlds like Pluto can have five moons in orbit. Moons come in many shapes, sizes and types.</p>
		<h2 id = "Mars">Mars</h2>
		<p>Mars is called the Red Planet.  Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps,<br> volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere<br> made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. There are signs of ancient floods on Mars,<br> but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds.</p>
		<h2 id = "Jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
		<p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is a gas giant <br>and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core<br> about the size of Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too<br> faint to see very well.</p>
		<h2 id = "Saturn">Saturn</h2>
		<p>Saturn is a gas giant made up mostly of hydrogen and helium.<br> Saturn's volume is greater than 760 Earths, and it is the second most massive planet in the solar system,<br> about 95 times Earth's mass. The Ringed Planet is the least dense of all the planets, <br>and is the only one less dense than water.</p>
		<h2 id = "Uranus">Uranus</h2>
		<p>Uranus is an ice giant (instead of a gas giant). It is mostly made<br> of flowing icy materials above a solid core. Uranus has a thick atmosphere made of methane,<br> hydrogen, and helium. Uranus is the only planet that spins on its side</p>
		<h2 id = "Neptune">Neptune</h2>
		<p>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. <br>It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. ... It's made of a thick fog of <br>water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center.</p>
				<h2 id = "Galaxy">Galaxies</h2>
		<p>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. <br>The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias, literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way.</p>
		<h2 id = "Galaxy-filaments">Galaxy filament</h2>
		<p>In physical cosmology, galaxy filaments are the<br> largest known structures in the universe.<br> They are massive, thread-like formations, <br>with a typical length of 50 to 80 megaparsecs h⁻¹ <br>that form the boundaries between large voids in the universe.<br> Filaments consist of gravitationally bound galaxies.</p>
		
		
		<h2 id = "Stars">Stars</h2>
		<p>Stars are huge celestial bodies made mostly of hydrogen and helium<br> that produce light and heat from the churning nuclear forges inside their cores. ...<br> It's impossible to know how many stars exist, but astronomers<br> estimate that in our Milky Way galaxy alone,<br> there are about 300 billion.</p>
		<h2 id = "Types-of-stars-heading">Types of stars</h2>
		<div id = "Types-of-stars">
		<h3>Red giant</h3>
		<p>A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate<br> mass in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere<br> is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface<br> temperature around 5,000 K or lower.</p>
		<h3>Neutron star</h3>
		<p>A neutron star is the collapsed core of a giant star, which before collapse<br> had a total mass of between 10 and 29 solar masses. Neutron stars are the<br> smallest and densest stars, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars,<br> and strange stars.</p>
		<h3>White dwarf</h3>
		<p>A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core<br> remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf<br> is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun,<br> while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. </p>
		<h3>Brown dwarf</h3>
		<p>A brown dwarf is a type of substellar object that has a mass<br> between those of the heaviest gas giant planets and the least massive stars, <br>i.e., approximately 13 to 75–80 times that of Jupiter,<br> or approximately 2.5×10²⁸ kg to about 1.5×10²⁹ kg.</p>
		<h3>Variable star</h3>
		<p>A variable star is a star whose brightness as seen from Earth fluctuates.</p>
		<h3>Protostar</h3>
		<p>A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud.<br> The protostellar phase is the earliest one in the process of stellar evolution.<br> For a low mass star, it lasts about 500,000 years.</p>
		<h3>Binary star</h3>
		<p>A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter.<br> Systems of two or more stars are called multiple star systems. <br>These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light,<br> and are then revealed as multiple by other means.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 id = "Void">Void</h2>
		<p>Cosmic voids are vast spaces between filaments, which contain very few or no galaxies.<br> Voids typically have a diameter of 10 to 100 megaparsecs; particularly large voids, defined by<br> the absence of rich superclusters, are sometimes called supervoids.</p>
		<h2 id = "Supercluster">Supercluster</h2>
		<p>A supercluster is a large group of smaller galaxy clusters or galaxy groups;<br> it is among the largest known structures of the universe. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group galaxy group,<br> which in turn is part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is part of the Laniakea Supercluster. </p>
		<h2 id = "Exoplanet">Exoplanet</h2>
		<p>An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System.<br> The first possible evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917, but was not recognized as such. <br>The first confirmation of detection occurred in 1992. This was followed by the confirmation of a different planet,<br> originally detected in 1988.</p>
		<h2 id = "Magnetar">Magnetar</h2>
		<p>A magnetar is a type of neutron star believed to have an extremely powerful magnetic field.<br> The magnetic field decay powers the emission of high-energy electromagnetic radiation,<br> particularly X-rays and gamma rays.</p>
		<h2 id = "Pulsar">Pulsar</h2>
		<p>A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation<br> out of its magnetic poles. This radiation can be observed<br> only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth,<br> and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission.</p>
		<h2 id = "Blazar">Blazar</h2>
		<p>A blazar is an active galactic nucleus with a relativistic jet directed very nearly towards an observer.<br> Relativistic beaming of electromagnetic radiation from the jet <br>makes blazars appear much brighter than they would be if<br> the jet were pointed in a direction away from Earth.</p>
		<h2 id = "Quasar">Quasar</h2>
		<p>A quasar is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus, in which a supermassive black hole<br> with mass ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun<br> is surrounded by a gaseous accretion disk.</p>
		<h2 id = "Star-cluster">Star cluster</h2>
		<p>Star clusters are groups of stars which are gravitationally bound.<br> Two distinct types of star cluster can be distinguished: <br>globular clusters are tight groups of hundreds of thousands of very old stars, while <br>open clusters generally contain less than a few hundred members, and are often very young</p>
		
		<div id = "Types-of-star-clusters">
		<h2>Types of star clusters</h2>
		<h3>Globular cluster</h3>
		<p>A globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic core.<br> Globular clusters are very tightly bound by gravity, which gives them their spherical shapes,<br> and relatively high stellar densities toward their centers.</p>
		<h3>Open cluster</h3>
		<p>An open cluster is a group of up to a few thousand stars that were formed from the same giant molecular cloud<br> and have roughly the same age. More than 1,100 open clusters<br> have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy,<br> and many more are thought to exist.<br></p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 id = "Minor-planet">Minor planet</h2>
		<p>A minor planet is an astronomical object in direct orbit around the Sun that is neither<br> a planet nor exclusively classified as a comet.</p>
		<h2 id = "Asteroid">Asteroid</h2>
		<p>Asteroids are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System.<br> Larger asteroids have also been called planetoids.</p>
		<h2 id = "Dwarf-planet">Dwarf planet</h2>
		<p>A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that does not dominate<br> its region of space and is not a satellite.</p>
		<div id = "Meteors-Meteoroids-and-Meteorites">
		<h2>Meteors, Meteoroids, and Meteorites</h2>
		<h3>Meteors</h3>
		<p>A meteor or shooting star is the visible streak of light from a heated and glowing object <br>falling through the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
		<h3>Meteoroids</h3>
		<p>A meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body <br>travelling through outer space.</p>
		<h3>Meteorites</h3>
		<p>A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from such a body which survives its passage <br>through the Earth's atmosphere, and falls to the Earth's surface.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 id = "Comets">Comets</h2>
		<p>A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun,<br> warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. <br>This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail.</p>
		<h2 id = "Blackholes">Blackholes</h2>
        <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing - <br>no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light - can escape from it. <br>The theory of general relativity predicts that a <br>sufficiently compact mass can deform <br>spacetime to form a black hole.</p>
